# Password-Generator

A random password generator 

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a random password generator that would spit out a random password. 
 
-At first I took a different aproach bye creating functions for each password category. 
 
-Then I found out the best way to do it was to create simple arrays for each and try to push and randomize them.

-I realized this at the last moment and had to scramble to get new code in. 

-At the moment the prompts come up asking you the questions about what you want in your password, but the password never gets displayed. 

-I will be working on this in more depth and fixing it. 

## Installation
