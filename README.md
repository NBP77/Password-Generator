## Description

-The main goal for this project was to creat a portfolio website that can hold all of the projects I will create during this program. 
 
-Each img has a link to my projects, the first is the Horiseon-Refactor I completed and the rest will fill in as the class progresses. 
 
-It was tough to match the exact layout that was provided because I am still getting used to using flexbox, some of the elements are not responsive with mobile devices.

-If I had the time I would have gone back and tried to put everything into flexbox instead of using absolute positioning. 

-At the end you are still able to view my profile, get my contacts, use the nav bar and view my projects. 

## Installation

To check the project, I worked on click on these links: 

GitHub: https://github.com/NBP77/Nicks-Portfolio

GitHub pages: https://nbp77.github.io/Nicks-Portfolio/ 

## Usage

Examples:

-Functional nav and contact bar

-Href directing you to ids on the page

-Clickable profile picture to social media 

-Hover effects on clickable imgs and links

-Big img for first project 

-Semantic HTML elements 

## Credits

I think the biggest resource for me was google, using it to look up flexbox and css positioning tips.
